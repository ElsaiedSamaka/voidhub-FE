  signout works!
</p>
<!-- for signing a user out all we have to do is the below code -->
<!-- force the user to navigate to the signout path this path is already defined with the SignoutComponent -->
<!-- the signoutcomponent itself contains the logic to make an api request to logging the user out -->
<!-- the request issued from this SignoutComponent at the backend contains the logic to clear token -->
<!-- once this request complete we are navigate user to "/" which in the current context is nothing but SigninComponent -->
